### 🚀 **Installation Instructions**

1. **Clone the dotfiles repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone --bare https://github.com/madsykle/dotfiles $HOME/.dotfiles
    ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:

    Install the necessary software like **Fish** and **Neovim**:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install fish neovim
    ```

3. **Configure the dotfiles repository**:

    Create an alias to make it easier to work with the dotfiles:

    ```bash
    alias config='git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'
    ```

4. **Remove existing conflicting files** (optional but recommended):

    If the files already exist on your new device, you may want to remove them to avoid conflicts. Use the following command to ensure that your dotfiles are in sync:

    ```bash
    config checkout
    ```

5. **Hide untracked files**:

    This step ensures that untracked files won't show up in the status, keeping your workspace clean:

    ```bash
    config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
    ```
